        <div class="mirror-body">
            All About Matcha is a small matcha shop based in Kyoto, Japan that sells matcha and provides tea ceremony
            classes on-site.
            Due to the Pandemic, they see a need for online business, so they want to expand their business to the
            online market.
            With the growing reputation of matcha overseas, they would like to put both their products and tea ceremony
            classes online.

    <div class="content mirror-body">

        <p>Competitive Analysis</p>

        I did research to understand the matcha market as well as to learn how people perceive
        matcha.
        I learned that a) matcha consumption is increasing as a superfood and b) the majority of people associate
        matcha with ice cream, desserts, or lattes.
        I also picked competitors who do tea ceremony lessons either online or in-person to see how they set up their
        booking process.

            </a>
        </div>





        <p>Survey</p>

        I conducted a survey to get overall impressions about matcha and Japanese Tea Ceremony.
        As I learned how people perceive matcha in competitive analysis, the majority of participants associated it with
        forms of desserts and drinks.
        For Japanese Tea Ceremony, I made an assumption that people associate it with strict manners and
        a sophisticated atmosphere, so I wanted to get quantitative results from the survey.
        My assumption was fairly correct, while a few people said that it would be a relaxing and peaceful experience.

            </a>
        </div>


        <p>1:1 User Interviews</p>
        I conducted user interviews with 6 individuals who like matcha. I learned that the majority of people would
        seek out Japanese Tea Ceremony as a cultural experience when they were in Japan or if they had the chance.
        However, a few participants (those who have lived in Japan before) said they would like to learn more about it.
        I decided to target those who would seek it out when given the chance, since they represent the majority
        of potential users in the United States.<br><br>

        Here are the major needs/pain points I got from the user interviews:

            <h1 class="stage-text">02. Define</h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content mirror-body">


        <p>Persona</p>

        To empathize with the users and remember their needs, I created a persona that
        represents a core user. At first, I was thinking that my target users are people who appreciate
        attending Japanese Tea Ceremony and drinking matcha as it is. However, I learned through my research
        that liking matcha doesn’t mean they would attend a class to get better at making matcha, but rather to learn
        about a new culture.

        <div>
            <a href=#img-persona class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/Persona.jpg" alt="Persona, Jessica Wong">

            </a>
        </div>


        <p>User Flow</p>

        After defining my persona, I created a user flow to visualize the paths that users would take to book a
        tea ceremony class.
        This reference helped me decide what to include and emphasize on the
        website as well as design the website with specific user tasks in mind.


        <div>
            <a href=#img-user-flow class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/User flow.jpg" alt="User flow">

            </a>
        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="stage2">
        <div class="content mirror-body">
            <h1 class="stage-text">03. Design</h1>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="content mirror-body">

        <p>Sketches</p>
        I started by sketching ideas of what I wanted to include. I made sure to include all the important
        information about matcha and Japanese Tea ceremony. From my research, I learned that
        people tend to associate matcha with only desserts or drinks, so I included other information that users
        can read to learn about other aspects of matcha.
        I also focused on having two things on the website: matcha e-commerce and online Japanese Tea Ceremony
        classes, since this is what the business does.



        <div>
            <a href=#img-sketches class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/Sketches.jpg" alt="Sketches three versions">
            </a>

            <a href="#!" class="lightbox" id="img-sketches">
                <span style="background-image: url('matcha-img/Sketches.jpg')"></span>
            </a>
        </div>

        <p>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</p>
        I started to work on wireframes based on the sketches, but I realized the website was overloaded with too much
        information about matcha. I wanted to put everything on one page, but the website had become confusing.
        I removed the unnecessary elements from the main page, to make sure that users don't get lost.

        <div>
            <a href=#img-wireframes class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/Wireflows.jpg" alt="Mirror, low-fi wireframes">
            </a>

            <a href="#!" class="lightbox" id="img-wireframes">
                <span style="background-image: url('matcha-img/Wireflows.jpg')"></span>
            </a>
        </div>


        After my first cleanup, there were still many pieces of information which made the main page look cluttered.
        I realized that the main page was losing its focus of what it was telling the users.
        I iterated on this several times and was able to streamline the design.

        <div>
            <a href=#img-wireframe-main class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/Wireframes main.jpg"
                    alt="Wireframes main page 3 iterations">
            </a>

            <a href="#!" class="lightbox" id="img-wireframe-main">
                <span style="background-image: url('matcha-img/Wireframes\ main.jpg')"></span>
            </a>
        </div>

        Additionally, at first there were two containers for private and group pages.
        However, I realized these two are almost the same except for the price and a few other details, so I combined
        them into one section.

        <div>
            <a href=#img-wireframe-class class="lightbox-link">
                <img class="mirror-content2" src="matcha-img/Wireframes iteration class.jpg"
                    alt="Wireframes class overview page 2 iterations">
            </a>

            <a href="#!" class="lightbox" id="img-wireframe-class">
                <span style="background-image: url('matcha-img/Wireframes\ iteration\ class.jpg')"></span>
            </a>
        </div>



        <p>Hi-Fidelity Responsive Design</p>
        Next I created hi-fidelity designs based on the wireframes. I decided to change the layout of the main page
        since it
        looked text-heavy.
        At first, I tried to leave all the text since I thought it's important for users to know what matcha is, but
        I realized people wouldn't care and just skip the reading part if they are not interested. I ended up making the
        text much shorter and gave users the option to read more if they are interested.
        I also tried hard not to make the website look too sophisticated since Japanese Tea Ceremony itself is already
        sophisticated enough to sometimes scare people away. To achieve this, I used soft and friendly colors rather
        than
        black, which a lot of matcha businesses do. Still, the images leave a hint of sophistication which shows the
        beauty of Japanese Tea Ceremony.

        I conducted usability tests to identify any frustrations/confusion users might have during each interaction, and
        whether it inhibits users from performing certain tasks.
        I recruited 3 individuals aged 24-28 who like matcha for the Zoom usability test. I also conducted a usability
        test using Maze, which I tested with 10 individuals.








        <p>Affinity Map</p>
        I synthesized the results and was able to determine what makes users frustrated or confused.
        I mainly got feedback about the tea ceremony classes and booking process, which I re-iterated on it.
        I searched for inspiration on how to improve the design, in order to deliver a better user experience.

        <p>Priority Revision</p>
        After analyzing what makes users frustrated or confused, I made revisions based on the
        solutions/improvements in the affinity map.
